# Pratyush Security Toolkit

A lightweight collection of security utilities written and curated by Pratyush.
This repository contains original code and small utilities inspired by multiple public tools, rewritten to be modular and production-friendly.

Quick start:
1. `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python -m toolkit.cli --help`

If any portion of the repo is derived from another MIT/Apache project, explicit credit appears in ORIGIN.md.
